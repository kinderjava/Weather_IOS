# Really-Simple-Weather-iOS

A very simple weather app that displays the current weather in a users location. This is pretty much the most basic and primative implementation of using the CoreLocation framework to get a users location and displaying the current weather conditions for that location.

Uses OpenWeatherMap for weather info - http://www.openweathermap.com/api
